# Website : Participatory approach to a complex spatially integrated design process 

Welcome to the website repository for the participatory part of GO CAWH. GO CAWH is a Dutch initiative, led by Rijkswaterstaat. The goal of GO CAWH is to connect the institutional (led by Rijks Universiteit Groningen), community (led by Co√∂peratie Kloostersland) and participatory position (led by Design Academy Eindhoven) in complex spatially design processes.

This website is dedicated to the approach from the participatory perspective. The objective for the participatory position is to identify possibilities for participation. On this website you will find a clear explanation of the scope of the process, led by the participatory representative, about the differences and connections between the people involved and a clear description of the tools available.

This website & digital tool is developed for: Design Academy Eindhoven, project GO CAWH, commissioned by RWS

Therefore feel free to take the code and adapt it,  but please give appropriate credit to the original developers.
2. **Fork this repository** and generate a **pull request**. The current maintainer will review the changes and on request can accept the changes to the current website. This might take some time. 
3. **Request access** to this repository, by which a new developer gets all the access to make changes accordingly. Contact the current developer. 


## For Developers 

The application is build with `react`, `vite` and `d3.js`. All data and information is included in the static website. No outside resources are needed. 

### Local development 

For local development get this repository and run: 

    git clone git@github.com:NieneB/participatory-tool.git

    cd participatory-tool

    npm install 

    npm run dev

The web page will now be available at: http://localhost:5173/participatory-tool/#/

### Deployment 

The website is deployed as a static website by gh-pages at: https://nieneb.github.io/participatory-tool/

Deployment is automatically configured when pushing to the  `main` branch. 

To request access please contact the developer or create a pull request. 

#### Locally testing the deployment 

To locally test the build deployment you can run: 

    npm run build

By default, the build output will be placed at `\dist`. To view the build locally run:  

    npm run preview 

It is important to note that vite preview is intended for previewing the build locally and not meant as a production server. The vite preview command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at http://localhost:4173. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
